# Backend Demo for Fullstack Users-Management Application using Spring RESTful API
This full-stack project aims to deliver a user-friendly management solution designed for efficiently managing users.
## About The Project
The solution includes a Java Spring RESTful API for the backend. This backend project is designed to provide robust user management capabilities through a RESTful API.
It includes CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for user profiles, allowing efficient handling of user data.
The backend system offers secure endpoints to create, retrieve, update, and delete user records, facilitating seamless integration with frontend applications for user management.
## This project helped me understand how to use Java Spring to build strong and scalable web applications. Here's what I learned:
- I learned how to use Spring Web MVC to handle web requests and responses effectively.
- I gained experience in using Spring Data JPA to work with databases, allowing me to create, read, update, and delete data.
- I also learned how to manage projects using Maven, organizing modules and dependencies efficiently to customize the build process for specific project needs.
